### 1. What are the three different configuration cases when determining the intersection of a pixel row with a triangle edge? 
### 2. In all three cases, what simple criterion can one use to determine whether the triangle edge overlaps the pixel row at all?

### 3. How might one use barycentric interpolation to determine whether or not a given point in space lies within the bounds of a triangle? 
### 4. In rasterization, would this method be more efficient than row bound checking for determining which pixels lie within a triangle? Why or why not?

### 5. Describe in detail the sequence of transformations that must occur in order to project a set of triangles given in 3D world space into the coordinate system of the pixelized screen.
